This is a sample project to describe the problem of constraint layout using the class leval hierarchy.

In this project we have created two diffrent type of chat bubble using the two diffrent xml files 

1.chat_recv_bubble_text.xml
2.chat_recv_bubble_text.xml

and we are inflating each view from the  ChatBubble.java.

# Problem we are facing.

1. Eventhough gravity of each bubble if diffrent it is showing left to the screen as shown in below screen shot.
2. We are not sure is it problem of the constratint layout or we are doing anything woring while inflacting the views.
